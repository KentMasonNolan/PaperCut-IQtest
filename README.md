# IQ test! #

This is my example script for the EduGeek [PaperCut](http://www.papercut.com/) 
print script competition.

See http://www.papercut.com/edugeek-comp/

Its objective is simple:

>
>   "Stop the bloody students printing to the IT Dept. Printer!"
>

This was done the laziest way I knew, hardcoding the questions and using
a random number generator to choose what one of five questions to ask.
Get the question wrong and the print job is then sent to a printer 
connected to a NUL port thus lost forever....They'll figure it out.

Change the questions to anything you like and get ready to laugh when
students start complaining their print jobs and money have disappeared
